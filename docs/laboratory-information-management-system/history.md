# History
The `History` is inventory specific. Select the inventory where you want to consult the history. 
## Group history

From the `Inventory Listing`:
1. Select `History` in the top banner. Here is the list of items removed by anyone in your group.
2. Use the same kind of [filters](/laboratory-information-management-system/items.html#filters) than those available in `Listing`. 
3. Use the dropdown menu `Type` to filter by [type of removal](/laboratory-information-management-system/items.html#different-type-of-removal).

## Personal history

From the `Listing` tick the box My history on the top to see only the items you personally removed.

## Item history

In the item overview (view icon) you can see the removal history of the item in the panel `Remove from stock`.
