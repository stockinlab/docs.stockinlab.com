# Add item

## Add new item

Before you start to add items, make sure your workspace is ready. You may need to create additional  parameters, and locations in the Dashboard (restricted to administrator). Creation of categories is not mandatory. However, when you add a new item you have to assign a category and/or a name.
Two different methods are available to add new item(s). Under Add/Update on the left panel:

Simple add: You can enter the details of an individual item, choose the location and click Add. If your items are stored in a box, select the spot(s) where your item is located. If it is not a box, simply add the quantity in the field provided.If you don’t know the location yet, you can save as draft. In the Extras panel, you can add comment to your item and attach files.

Add with import: See the procedure to use an Excel file.

## Use an Excel file to import items

Use these option if you have a bulk of items to enter into the inventory. Tick the categories in which you need to enter your new items. Click Download template and open the file. One sheet per category is created. Fill all the fields (the location cannot be enter in the file, you have to allocate after the import).
/!\ Make sure you enter the good value for the parameter set as “Select” in your workspace. To make the process easier, the ID of the options are referenced in a separate sheet. If you parameter is a “Select” type just enter the ID of the option (and note the name of the option).
When your file is ready, go back to Add with import, select the file to import in Choose file and click Import.
In case of error, the details of the error appear. It can be a mandatory field not filled, an item with exact same details already existing (you can force to add), a blank line.
Lastly, Select the location of all the new imported items.
                
## Private/Public items

Private items can be seen by your team only. If you switch for Public, your items are visible in the Public Items listing (Global inventory/Public) by all the teams. The details of the item are visible for all but the location remains hidden. Users from other teams can contact you if they are interested by your item.

## Pick location of the item

When you add a new item (from Simple Add) select the location in the Locations panel. If your items are stored in a box, select the spot(s) where your item is located. If it is not a box, simply add the quantity in the field provided. If you items are in multiple locations, select the additional location from the dropdown menu.If you don’t know the location yet, you can save as draft.
When you add items from a file, the locations are allocated after the import on the same principle.
 
 ## Add attachment(s)
 
 You can attach documents in several format (pdf, xlsx, docx, pptx, images…)
When you add the item, attach the documents in the Extras panel. you can click in the box to find into your computer the documents to attach or simply drag and drop your documents.
You can attach documents later to your item by clicking (pen) icon in the overview (loupe) of the item.

## Add as draft

In the case you don’t know the location of your yet, don’t fill the location panel and click Save as draft. Draft items can be found from the general listing (Item/Listing), tick Draft items on the top. Later, when you know the location, click (loupe) to see the details of your item and click (pen) on the top to edit the location. You item will be automatically transferred from the Draft items to the Listing.

## Mandatory fields

If fields mandatory are not filled, the button Add remain disabled. Mandatory fields can be set from the Dashboard. You can also add more optional parameters directly from the adding panel

## Receive item from another group

When you received items transferred from another team, a notification New transfer appears into the left panel of your workspace. All the items received are listed, click Recover to add the item into your inventory.
Select the category where you want to store the received item and select the parameters to allocate for the details of the item. In case the parameter does not exist in your workspace you can choose to clone the parameter. Then, choose the location of the item (only the quantity received can be stored, you will get a error message if you are trying to store more).
