## Create or edit a parameter

Under the `Dashboard` menu, click on `Parameters`.
Check the list of `Global Parameters` that are common to every group before you add a new parameter (that apply only to your group).
Click `Add` on top right and enter the name of your new parameter.
Select the `Type` of your parameters among the list provided.

From the overview of the parameters, you can edit one of them by clicking (pen).
Click (trash) to delete the parameter.

## Global parameter

`Global parameters` are created by the super-administrator of your server and are common to every team. By using them to link with your categories, you will be able to easily share your items with other groups.

## Expiry date parameter

When you create the parameter the option `Expiry Date` into `Type` is available.
When you add an item into the inventory, specify the day of expiry and you will get a notification when the date has passed for this item.
