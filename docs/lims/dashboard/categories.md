# Categories

## Create / edit category

Under the `Dashboard` menu, click on `Categories`. Click `Add` on top right and choose in which inventory you want to create the new category.

1. If the new category depends on another category, select the parent category first under `Dependence`
2. Enter the name of your new category
3. `Status` can be changed to `Inactive` anytime to hide a category in the inventory
4. An `IRB reference` and `IRB expiry date` can be added \(applicable for a category of human samples, i.e. patient cohort\)
5. Add `Mandatory parameters` to assign to your category if needed

.. . .  \(make sure you create the list of parameters first\). From the overview of the categories, you can edit one of them by clicking \(pen\). Click \(+\) to add directly a sub-category to this category. Click \(trash\) to delete the category.
